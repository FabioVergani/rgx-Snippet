#Notes
Sometimes you will see double colons (::) instead of just one (:)
This is part of CSS3 and an attempt to distinguish
between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
Most browsers support both values.

::selection always starts with double colons (::).

You can use only one pseudo-element in a selector:
 It must appear after the simple selectors in the statement.
